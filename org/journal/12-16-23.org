*** /What are your thoughts?/
Lord God, thank You for this day which you have given me.
I was troubled with dreams in my sleep but You awoke me, O Lord,
and saved me. I shall wake up and praise You, go throughout the day
and praise You, then before falling asleep praise You.

My dream wasn't super clear, it had Ava, but the thought of her not
finding peace that our Lord provides has diminished, for I trust the
Lord will solve these things which I cannot solve. If I see her in
public, I shall not shun her, I shall show her love and care.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To get all of my normal todos done before lunch and then work a good amount on both
ciss245 stuff and calc-based physics. Eventually I want to get SDL figured out as well,
might do that today we'll see. Alongside SDL, I want to figure out LaTeX as well ...

***** summarization:
This was the Person-Hypostasis chapter, in which it described many things.
One of these being, that Christ is the ultimate example and without Him,
we wouldn't understand neither ourselves nor God fully. He is the total
recapitulation of the creation and fall of man. Though the Trinity as a
whole (The essence of God (Father) and His corresponding energies) plays
a part in man's salvation, the Word of God is the aspect in which we
know the Father through the Holy Spirit.

It also talked of the opposing views outside of Christianity, and how they
all fail to "unite" individuals with the whole personhood of humanity.
They fail to provide comfort resulting in, when looking at their system
and what it can provide, nihilistic loneliness.

It's going well, I like my new hat.

** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
The Lord blessed me with parents that feed me, take me places, and want to enjoy life with me.
I want to spread the Gospel more, and Christ's Church, but I'm not near enough ready, but I want
to acquire this courage and pain of heart for others. So that I reach the content of man, in that
I fully realize the reality of the fall and of Adam (mankind) in general. Lord, I pray for this
enlightenment.
** DONE Remembrance

Gluttony, I went grocery shopping to prepare better for the fast,

* Habit trackers
I figured out how I can habit track with org-mode now. As you can see, my Bible plan is
in org-agenda and it's counting the days, so, if I want to keep track of a habit, I can
go into templates and enter the day I started the habit and the day of which I would open
my org file, so then on the agenda it counts the days in a fractional manner. If I fail the
habit, I just go into templates and reset the starting day and if I don't want the habit I
can rid of it in the template altogether. This means that it all depends on my template and
what my template does will help me see it in my daily todos as well as automatically update
my org-agenda accordingly.

I just figured out that it's not working exactly how I need it, I may have to delete the header
of the Bible plan. Let me experiment... 

I figured that I will just make a todo such that I can visit the todo if I want to to find out the day count
(usually only if i don't have my supernote with me) but in the future I imagine I will find out a better way
for todos.
