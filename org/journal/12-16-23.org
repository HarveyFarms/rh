*** /What are your thoughts?/
Lord God, thank You for this day which you have given me.
I was troubled with dreams in my sleep but You awoke me, O Lord,
and saved me. I shall wake up and praise You, go throughout the day
and praise You, then before falling asleep praise You.

My dream wasn't super clear, it had Ava, but the thought of her not
finding peace that our Lord provides has diminished, for I trust the
Lord will solve these things which I cannot solve. If I see her in
public, I shall not shun her, I shall show her love and care.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To get all of my normal todos done before lunch and then work a good amount on both
ciss245 stuff and calc-based physics. Eventually I want to get SDL figured out as well,
might do that today we'll see. Alongside SDL, I want to figure out LaTeX as well ...

* Habit trackers
I figured out how I can habit track with org-mode now. As you can see, my Bible plan is
in org-agenda and it's counting the days, so, if I want to keep track of a habit, I can
go into templates and enter the day I started the habit and the day of which I would open
my org file, so then on the agenda it counts the days in a fractional manner. If I fail the
habit, I just go into templates and reset the starting day and if I don't want the habit I
can rid of it in the template altogether. This means that it all depends on my template and
what my template does will help me see it in my daily todos as well as automatically update
my org-agenda accordingly.
