    woke up late today, but I'll get back to work and fix sleep schedule

    but it's hard to get this sleep schedule when we have practice so late

    Just rest after the mock meet practice.

    I ran a 56.97 400m dash.
    Not bad for circumstances.
- [X] *Evening reflection*
  + /How's it all going?/
    I need to pray and repent. Reading my catechism book which contains a whole myriad of quotes from
    the Holy Fathers convicts me greatly, also Safeguard of the Soul puts my nous into perspective on
    what really matters, theosis.

    God has blessed me with life, but I have sinned against Him by using His gift for evil. Lord, have mercy.

    Prayer to Accept the Will of God

    O Lord, I do not know what to ask of You. You alone know what I need. You love me more than I am able to love You. Father, give Your servant that for which I am unable to ask.
    I do not dare to ask either for a cross or for consolation, I only stand before You. My heart is open to You, and You Yourself see the needs of which I am unaware. See and do
    according to Your mercy. Strike me and heal me; knock me down and lift me up. I show reverence and keep silence before Your holy will: Your destiny for me is beyond understanding.
    I offer myself as a sacrifice to You. I have no other desire besides the desire to carry out Your will. Teach me how to pray - and You Yourself pray in me! Amen.
