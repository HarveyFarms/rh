*** /What did you do?/ 
Did some mobility with kettlebell in the morning
** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I'm a little anxious for my meet today, I'm not sure how good I'll perform. I'm scared
that I'll underperform and that will discourage me for future meets/practices. I shall
lay aside these thoughts that do me no good, and instead keep loving the Lord, and perform
as best as I can that gives Him all of the glory.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Focus is to try and get some work done, but not be hyperfocused on it.
Instead, have fun at the meet, perform well, and see my family that is coming to watch me.
Glory to You, O God.
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
I plan to start working on pygame/reversi today, and for pygame I'm going to be
creative with my layout and all of the images I make for the game. It's going to
be fun. I just can't wait till I have python done with so I can focus more on C++
and maybe come back to python at a later time. I need to solve problems first with
something like C++, so I have a general understanding of things/formulas before it's
heavily simplified with Python.

** DONE Make sure all daily goals are met 
** DONE Mobility/Isometrics ideas: [[~/kettlebell.org][w/kettlebell]] [[mobility.org][w/o kettlebell]]
*** /What did you do?/
will do some kettlebell things when I get back to my dorm
** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
With this new setup I have for org-journal I can make headers "DONE" and
if I don't finish something, I can leave a "TODO" on it. so I
can come back to it tomorrow.

I need to have some focus on track. I did alright today but I'm afraid that
I will slip away from the sport. These last couple days I've been doing well on
some little mobility exercises but maybe I need to find a time throughout the week
to go to the gym and get some good ATG work in, to cover all needed areas and then
maximize good sprinting/workouts at practice (focus/performance-wise)
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
What a blessed day filled with lovely people in my life.
My mom, dad, laura, grandma and grandpa Harvey came down
to see me run track today, in which I ran a 52.87
and then in the 4x4 I ran a 53.7

My teammates, my coaches, and all who support me behind the
scenes and even feed me, thank you God for them. Have mercy
on them and help me on my path to repentance that I may live
a better life in You and serve back those who serve me.
** DONE Evening creativity
*** /What do you want to express?/
Every day, I want to improve in God. 
But I feel that I don't...
I feel the same old person I was years ago.
I don't see any difference.
Maybe God allows this, so that
we may repent and never forget our
wrongdoings against Him.
** DONE Hygiene
** Make sure everything is plugged in
** Prayer
** 7:30+ hours of sleep

High importance, need to study this week and even during finals week
review for Calc, ciss240 and ciss145. If confident in all of these
then look at pointer notes for ciss240 and starting leaning away from
python and start focusing only on ciss240.
