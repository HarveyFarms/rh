** DONE Mobility/Strength ideas: [[~/kettlebell.org][w/kettlebell]] [[mobility.org][w/o kettlebell]]
*** /What did you do?/ 
Did some mobility with kettlebell in the morning
** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I'm a little anxious for my meet today, I'm not sure how good I'll perform. I'm scared
that I'll underperform and that will discourage me for future meets/practices. I shall
lay aside these thoughts that do me no good, and instead keep loving the Lord, and perform
as best as I can that gives Him all of the glory.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Focus is to try and get some work done, but not be hyperfocused on it.
Instead, have fun at the meet, perform well, and see my family that is coming to watch me.
Glory to You, O God.
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
I plan to start working on pygame/reversi today, and for pygame I'm going to be
creative with my layout and all of the images I make for the game. It's going to
be fun. I just can't wait till I have python done with so I can focus more on C++
and maybe come back to python at a later time. I need to solve problems first with
something like C++, so I have a general understanding of things/formulas before it's
heavily simplified with Python.

High importance, need to study this week and even during finals week
review for Calc, ciss240 and ciss145. If confident in all of these
then look at pointer notes for ciss240 and starting leaning away from
python and start focusing only on ciss240.
