Thank You Lord, for the peaceful night that You granted me.

Thank You Lord, for helping me rise out of bed, by Your Cross,
O Savior, I realized where I need to be spiritually.
** DONE Reflection
Woke up at 3 AM, slept a little longer until 3:45, sat in
bed for a bit, pondering because I had to pee and it was
about time to get up, I made the sign of the cross and
started my day.

My dream was a weird one, it had to do with a bus, parties,
and people in my class from high school.

** DONE Bible 
*** Old Testament
Chapter 49 and 50 of Genesis were the last chapters.
It ended with Jacob (Israel) prophesying of his sons
and then passing away, where Joseph and all of his brothers
buried Jacob where Abraham, Isaac, etc. were buried.
Then Joseph passed away, and he promised his brethren that
God was surely visit them and bring them out of the land to
the land that God swore to their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. This prefigures both the exodus out of Egypt and the
resurrection from the dead.
*** Psalms
Ps 20 starts with a king who believes and hopes in God and
is in return blessed by Him. It then talks of how God will
destroy His enemies, namely the devil and his angels.

"Ps 20 is also a royal psalm, because it is a prophecy of the King's triumphal
Ascension, in which He is also the End."
*** Proverbs
continued from yesterday:
It talks of practical wisdom and guidance:
1. Give to the poor, and don't delay such a thing.
2. Don't harm a friend, for they trust in you.
3. Don't quarell with a man, lest he do you harm.
4. Don't incur the reproach of evil men, neither seek their ways. 
   incur: to become liable or subject to.

4 continued:
- For every lawless man is unclean before the Lord, and he does not sit among
  the righteous
- The curse of God is in the houses of the ungodly, but He blessed the dwellings
  of the righteous
- The Lord opposes the arrogant, but He gives grace to the humble.
- The wise shall inherit glory, but the ungodly exalt dishonor.

This wisdom is important because I constantly at it, but reading it straight on, when
my mind is in a state of cloudiness and carelessness would set me on straight paths.

I have to realize that temptations are ~temporary~. They will go away.

Proverbs is truly a life-giving book, so is the rest of the Bible, but proverbs speaks to those
who want to follow the ways of righteousness, with practical and wise advice.
*** New Testament
Firstly, Christ healed a demon-possessed man and the Scribes/Pharisees said that
He casts demons away by the ruler of demons, Christ points out their hypocrisy
and mentions many things including, "How can you enter a strong man's house and
plunder his goods without binding the strong man up?" Jesus then ends by saying
that those who deny the works of the Holy Spirit condemn theirselves, and harden
their own hearts, and are unrepentant because of this. Also, He mentions how man
will have to give an account for every idle word (sin) that man shall speak (commit).

The Pharisees then ask Christ for a sign, but He rebukes them, essentially saying that
this sinful generation wants a sign but it shall not be given to them, because of their 
wicked intent, except the sign of the resurrection, which Paul even claims to be the sign
that he would give, "We preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock and unto
the Greeks foolishness."
