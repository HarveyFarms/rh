  + /What did you do?/ ideas: [[~/kettlebell.org][w/kettlebell]] [[mobility.org][w/o kettlebell]] 
    I did mobility with kettlebell then some isometrics with abs.
- [X] *Evening reflection*
  + /How's it all going?/
    It's going okay. I love Ava, yet I can't go on with her. If she wants to
    maintain her autonomy and follow herself, then I can't be in a lasting
    relationship with her, and I should break off any bad relationships that
    would harm both me and her. School work and studying is going to ramp up these next two weeks,
    may God bless me so that I can do what's needed, but never forgetting Him is the most important
    part. Amen.
- [X] *Evening thanks*
  + /How've you been blessed today?/
    I've been blessed with my CS friends, who threw a birthday party for Cole, and I got to be there
    to celebrate. Also I'm grateful for the Holy Orthodox Church, that, through God has provided me
    with texts to contemplate and better know God, and grow morally but most importantly spiritually.
    Changing my whole being so that it's in accordance with Him.
- [X] *Evening creativity*
