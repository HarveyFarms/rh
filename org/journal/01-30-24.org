*** Bible 
**** Old Testament (Nm 4:34-6:26)
The law against unfaithful wives and of the extraordinary vow (asceticism) was given. Then the reading ended off with the great priestly blessing, which is in the Lord's name and is powerful and life-giving.

~The Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make His face shine upon you, and be merciful to you; the Lord lift up His countenance upon you, and give you peace~
**** Psalms (41; 42)
**** Proverbs (8:27-31)
**** New Testament (Mt 27:27-44)
This is the beginning of the path to crucifixion of Christ. They mocked Christ with glorious titles, all of which Christ was worthy of, but their hardened hearts didn't let them see the Truth right before them.
*** The Divine Liturgy
**** starting page: 90
**** ending page  : 96
**** summarization: 
the departed, incense, and Christ clothed in majesty. (~The Lord has reigned. He has clothed Himself in majesty~)
