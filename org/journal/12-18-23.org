** DONE Morning reflection & thanksgiving
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I went to sleep without praying and I woke up without praying, both times I wasted double the
time I would be praying with my phone. Lord, forgive me, and keep me from the snares of the Devil.

But thank You, Lord, for this day, in which eventually I did rise out of bed and focused on You and
Your commandments.

Thank You for the very breath you give me, for the family you give me, both in Your Church and my kin.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To do both yesterdays and todays Bible plan/daily reading,
get a haircut, work for Laura, and do some sprint training
along with some weightlifting.

If I have time at the end of the day I can return to pointers & arrays
chapter.

** DONE Make sure all daily goals are met

*** /How's it all going?/
Laura, my dad and I argued about religion and beliefs for over two hours.
Afterwards I felt hopeless.

Also at the track today it seemed my hands were about to freeze.
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
The Lord blessed me with life.

He blesses me in all ways and in ways I can't even bring to mind now because I am
tired and am in constant agitation with my mind after arguing for You, the True God.
** DONE Remembrance 
*** /Enter any sins you have committed today./
Failing to even confess my beliefs well or live them out prior to confessing them, have mercy on me, Lord.

Despondency, after I saw Remi run off and not care to tell others or even help out in getting him back.
