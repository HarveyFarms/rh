** DONE Morning reflection & thanksgiving
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I went to sleep without praying and I woke up without praying, both times I wasted double the
time I would be praying with my phone. Lord, forgive me, and keep me from the snares of the Devil.

But thank You, Lord, for this day, in which eventually I did rise out of bed and focused on You and
Your commandments.

Thank You for the very breath you give me, for the family you give me, both in Your Church and my kin.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To do both yesterdays and todays Bible plan/daily reading,
get a haircut, work for Laura, and do some sprint training
along with some weightlifting.

If I have time at the end of the day I can return to pointers & arrays
chapter.
