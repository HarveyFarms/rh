***** summarization:
The first chapter I read in these pages was "Love for enemies," in which
it was shown that love for enemies is central to Christianity as it shows
the perfection in the faith, which was shown as a perfect example and
archetype in Christ. Christ said to love your enemies, and that to do so
would be to be perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.

The next chapter was about Pure Prayer, in which it described a gift that
some monks achieve that is one of the purest gifts that the Holy Spirit
transmits to the pure of heart. This prayer transcends normal prayer,
it goes beyond the limits of the created and finiteness of this world,
and it transcends the faithful to oneness with humanity, in which his
nous is raised and made one with all of their createdness and God's
uncreatedness. The experience that the monk feels when in pure prayer
is one that is described of not even knowing whether one is in the body
or outside the body when praying.

One important theme that I noticed is that the faith in Christ is not one
that is totally intellectual, it can be given a good account for, philosophically
and intellectually, because God would be most logically consistent and provide
the best wisdom for the world, no matter the season. But even this won't save
anyone, it can be a starting point or a continually growing in knowledge of God,
but God has provided His faithful, Orthodox Christians, with a ~life~, an experience,
a communion with ~Him~. This is the end all be all for what God provides to know Him.
