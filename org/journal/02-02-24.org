**** Old Testament (Nm 11:1-14:10)
the 11th chapter had the people grumbling against God and they were gluttonous for meat, very convienient that it's a fast day, and the Lord promised them meat for a month, so much so that they would regret asking for it. It ended up where people had meat between their teeth and the Lord struck them with a great plague.

the 12th and 13th chapter is one of the Lord promising the land of Canaan to the Israelites, but after sending spies there, the Canaanites seem to be formidable enemies.
