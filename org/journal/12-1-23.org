  + /What are your thoughts?/
    I think I need to get some sleep.

    My problem is that I put off going to sleep because I
    know I'll have to pray before I sleep, so I procrastinate
    because the devil convinces me that praying is not worth
    my time and I can do other things, etc. when that cannot
    be further from the truth.

    I should purge this idea, pray to God, and get good sleep.
- [X] *Morning intention*
  + /Overall focus of today?/

- [X] *Morning creativity*
  + /Feeling creative or smart?/
    The devil is scared that I might follow the One True God.
    So he, with all of his might, tempts me to stay away from
    the One who cast him out for his evil will.

    God allows this, that I might grow in Him, and I believe it's
    working. Nevertheless, I shall continue to take up my cross
    and not work alone, but with God (and His all-powerful name) on my side
    and with my Church community, that we might grow to be godly and
    ever-pleasing to God the Father.

  + /What do you want to express?/
    I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth, and of
    all things visible and invisible.

    And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father
    before all ages, Light of Light. True God of True God. Begotten not created, of one
    essence with the Father, through Whom all things are made.

    Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Heaven and was incarnate of the Holy
    Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became Man. He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,
    He suffered and was buried. And He rose on the third day, according to the Scriptures.

    He ascended into Heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father, His Kingdom shall
    have no end.

    And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Creator of Life, who proceeds from the Father. Who
    together with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified. Who spoke through the
    prophets.

    In One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church.
    I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins.
    I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the
    life of the age to come. Amen.
