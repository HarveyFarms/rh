I can't stop thinking of me and Ava's relationship...

If I can bring up the big questions over break, then I'll see how they get resolved.
I just don't want to avoid the issue, because it breaks me spiritually that I mislead her with my own sinful will
that I follow when I'm around her. And then she thereby thinks that my faith isn't that important which is false.

Even if the relationship ends, I need to bring it up, because it's causing me great sorrow. Help me God, and save me.

Now I better understand what You said, Lord. "Those who love their life shall lose it,
and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."

Loving life in this world is distracting oneself with pleasures and vanities, which is
trying to save one from the sorrows of this world. The world is full of great evil, and
a true man will have sorrows against this cruel world, where it seems there is no hope.

Along with the cruelty of the world, there is the cruelty of the self, which can drive man
even deeper into sorrows. The man tries to follow righteousness but ends up betraying himself
over and over and again and again. This brings ultimate sorrows, to the point where he hates
his life, and has to do things such as fasting to prevent such a cruel version of himself.
A constant continual striving for God is not one of worldly pleasures, it is one of patience,
chasteness, and ultimately a complete obedience to His will.

The earth that the Lord made is good, but our corruption of it and our very selves is what should be hated.
Those who don't hate this corruption are willfully blinding themselves, so as to not know and live out Truth.
