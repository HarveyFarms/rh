*** /What are your thoughts?/
I can't stop thinking of me and Ava's relationship...

If I can bring up the big questions over break, then I'll see how they get resolved.
I just don't want to avoid the issue, because it breaks me spiritually that I mislead her with my own sinful will
that I follow when I'm around her. And then she thereby thinks that my faith isn't that important which is false.

Even if the relationship ends, I need to bring it up, because it's causing me great sorrow. Help me God, and save me.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Be steady and get work done, continue the fast.
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
Now I better understand what You said, Lord. "Those who love their life shall lose it,
and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal."

Loving life in this world is distracting oneself with pleasures and vanities, which is
trying to save one from the sorrows of this world. The world is full of great evil, and
a true man will have sorrows against this cruel world, where it seems there is no hope.

Along with the cruelty of the world, there is the cruelty of the self, which can drive man
even deeper into sorrows. The man tries to follow righteousness but ends up betraying himself
over and over and again and again. This brings ultimate sorrows, to the point where he hates
his life, and has to do things such as fasting to prevent such a cruel version of himself.
A constant continual striving for God is not one of worldly pleasures, it is one of patience,
chasteness, and ultimately a complete obedience to His will.

The earth that the Lord made is good, but our corruption of it and our very selves is what should be hated.
Those who don't hate this corruption are willfully blinding themselves, so as to not know and live out Truth.

*** /What did you do?/
kettlebell mobility
** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
It's all going alright, I just need to get to work instead of on my phone and waste time.
And all of my work should be towards/tied to theosis.
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
I thank God for those who feed me. They don't know I'm supposed to be fasting, they're feeding a man in their eyes.
For that I thank them. I reprimand myself for allowing myself to fall away from the fast again and again. For selfish
reasons that would never be fulfilled. I prepared with tuna, but I never even fell back on that. I was too eager to
eat which was shown when walking back to the dorm after Dulany.
** DONE Evening creativity
*** /What do you want to express?/
My God, I do not know all the reasons why Your One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church
follows such an ascetic path vs other Christian denominations. But I do know that this is
Your Church and this is the tried and True path to Theosis. I shall be obedient to what
Your Church shows me, because through the Church, You are the One behind it all.
