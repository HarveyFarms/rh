Christ is born! Therefore glorify Him!

I wasn't able to go to the nativity today at Church since my family wanted to do Christmas gift-giving in
the morning, which was sad. I don't think they realize how much the Church means to me, in the life it g-
ives me in God. It makes me sorrowful. I'll be patient, and most of all hope and pray for their salvation.
** DONE Morning intention
To simply get my daily todos done before heading to grandma Harveys house. I'll see if I can work on some
physics stuff as well as some calculus. I also want to code but I'm not sure where to start... I may try
to expand on that one project of the social media following chart.

***** summarization:
It talked more of Divine Liturgy, and what it means to partake of His blood
and how crucial this is for our lives.

It mentioned also how preparing ourselves for communion is also crucial,
mentioning how Paul said that it's condemning if we partake unworthily
(without repentance and with pridefulness).

The last chapter was HOW to prepare ourselves for Divine Liturgy. It mentioned
practical strategies, like reading verses before going and meditating on them
as well as have a fearful night before hand. It summed up all of these things
saying that the whole of a Christian life is to prepare oneself, by having
contrition and repentance to the point of worthy tears, so that they are like
the prodigal son in saying, "Father, make me one of your hired servants."
