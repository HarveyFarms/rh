Christ is born! Therefore glorify Him!

I wasn't able to go to the nativity today at Church since my family wanted to do Christmas gift-giving in
the morning, which was sad. I don't think they realize how much the Church means to me, in the life it g-
ives me in God. It makes me sorrowful. I'll be patient, and most of all hope and pray for their salvation.
** DONE Morning intention
To simply get my daily todos done before heading to grandma Harveys house. I'll see if I can work on some
physics stuff as well as some calculus. I also want to code but I'm not sure where to start... I may try
to expand on that one project of the social media following chart.

***** summarization:
It talked more of Divine Liturgy, and what it means to partake of His blood
and how crucial this is for our lives.

It mentioned also how preparing ourselves for communion is also crucial,
mentioning how Paul said that it's condemning if we partake unworthily
(without repentance and with pridefulness).

The last chapter was HOW to prepare ourselves for Divine Liturgy. It mentioned
practical strategies, like reading verses before going and meditating on them
as well as have a fearful night before hand. It summed up all of these things
saying that the whole of a Christian life is to prepare oneself, by having
contrition and repentance to the point of worthy tears, so that they are like
the prodigal son in saying, "Father, make me one of your hired servants."

** DONE Evening reflection
Today was a good Christmas. Not the best since I couldn't go to Church but seeing family was great.

I got work done but I am ever reminded of how much better I should be spending my time and actually
getting things done in that time period. But first I need to eliminate distractions.
** DONE Evening thanks
Thank You Lord, for showing Mankind love when You sent down Your only-begotten
Son and Word to humanity, to raise Mankind from where it had fallen aforetime.

Thank You God for every breath You give me.
** DONE Remembrance 
I was a glutton today.

I have contrition in the mornings/evenings and sometimes throughout the day but
I never hold fast to good and wise practices that the Lord has laid down for me
to keep. I need to work on this, I need to improve my prayer and this is a good
way to do that.
