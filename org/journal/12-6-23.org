To get mild work done, at a steady pace. Instead of taking my phone around I'll take my
prayer rope around. Instead of scrolling social media, I'll scroll my prayer rope.

*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
I'm going to need to feel smart for this math quiz.

It's the final one for the semester and I'm not 100% on 5.1 and 5.2

But today is going to be a math day so if I
start before class I should be more prepared.
