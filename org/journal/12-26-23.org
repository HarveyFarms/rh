** DONE Morning thanksgiving & reflection 
I thank the Lord for this beautiful day which He has given me.

I thank the Lord for the very breath that I breathe, for every
pump of my heart that brings me life to return to Him.

I'm ever so aware that my prayer life isn't close to God. I feel as if I'm
distant and cold from Him. After joining Orthodoxy, I'm faced with spiritual
realities and all of the truths that come with them. For example, I feel cold
from God because I have been willingly straying from His commandments. In the
past, I might've felt close to God (I rarely prayed) but that prayer didn't
bring me to repentance or a change in my lifestyle so that I become a more
proficient worker of His commandments. And even if it did, I didn't have the
whole Truth of God when I tried to repent. I wouldn't and didn't know how to
fall back on Him, and to rely on Him for everything, which is done through
the slightest contrition and untrustworthiness of oneself that returns man
back to God in prayer.
** DONE Morning intention
I intend to read all of my daily readings before 12, then head to the track
and warehouse, will I will have an explosive day with some accessories.

After my workout, I will come home and work on my project, or some math to
get better at that. I want to return to calc-based physics, even if it's
small progress, I want to progress in that.
