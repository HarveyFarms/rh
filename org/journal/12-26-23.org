** DONE Morning thanksgiving & reflection 
I thank the Lord for this beautiful day which He has given me.

I thank the Lord for the very breath that I breathe, for every
pump of my heart that brings me life to return to Him.

I'm ever so aware that my prayer life isn't close to God. I feel as if I'm
distant and cold from Him. After joining Orthodoxy, I'm faced with spiritual
realities and all of the truths that come with them. For example, I feel cold
from God because I have been willingly straying from His commandments. In the
past, I might've felt close to God (I rarely prayed) but that prayer didn't
bring me to repentance or a change in my lifestyle so that I become a more
proficient worker of His commandments. And even if it did, I didn't have the
whole Truth of God when I tried to repent. I wouldn't and didn't know how to
fall back on Him, and to rely on Him for everything, which is done through
the slightest contrition and untrustworthiness of oneself that returns man
back to God in prayer.
** DONE Morning intention
I intend to read all of my daily readings before 12, then head to the track
and warehouse, will I will have an explosive day with some accessories.

After my workout, I will come home and work on my project, or some math to
get better at that. I want to return to calc-based physics, even if it's
small progress, I want to progress in that.

**** Hypostatic Prayer
***** starting page: 210

***** study/read   : study
***** summarization:
First chapter was the ethos of Christ and the ethos of man.
In here, man has to recognize his fallen state and in God
willfully raise it up to be worthy of Him. Here we see how
getting closer to God at the pinnacle of the pyramid can be
shown as an inverted pyramid, where humbling oneself allows
one to descend to the One who humbled himself beyong no compare.

In the next chapter, "Sharing in the Priesthood of Christ," it
talks of priests and their role in the Liturgy, which is one of
honor but of great sacrifice and toil. Just as when man prays
unworthily, he is condemned, such is the case for priests, who
carry a heavier burden in that manner, let us pray for all priests
who teach and lead their flocks in the true faith.

"Thanksgiving and Supplication" is the next chapter, where it marks
the importance that Christians should praise and give thanks to God
for all things that they know and also for the things they don't know.
They should do this first and foremost.

"The Eschatological Dimension of the Divine Liturgy" shows how Liturgy
is eternal, as it was planned before all ages to bring man back to God,
after Man had chosen vain, created things over God.

"Christ-like Suffering" lays out the essence of a Christian life, which
is one of suffering. This doesn't mean there is no joy in a Christians
life, it just means that through knowledge of man's lowness and knowledge
of God's highness. Or through knowledge of the corruptibility of the created
and the knowledge of the incorruptibility of the uncreated, we are ever so
humbled and strive to life a life for God that isn't the most pleasant, filled
with self-abaseness and sacrifices so that we are like an ancient tree, who is
able to persevere every new year because of the deep, strong roots that reach
far into the ground.
**** Algorithms to Live By
***** starting page: 31
***** ending page  : 59
***** study/read   : read
***** summarization:
The explore/exploit rule offers insight to how we view decisions
that will effect other decisions in the future.

For example, should we just settle on the first thing that we
come by, for every scenario? No, of course not. Should we settle
on never settling? Neither that. Optimizing this can be based
on set algorithms, where the cost of further decisions is judged
with the decision at hand. These algorithms always favor the un-
known, since the present is always most valuable and the known
isn't favored over the unknown, because the latter could be better.

It also mentions how explore/exploit plays into our lives, in that
young people necessarily need to explore, where older people
necessarily need to exploit. This isn't the case for ALL things,
of course but for most things. I imagine in the case of Truth it is
telling how following falsehoods when exploring can lead one back
to the Truth who doesn't let them down. This part of the chapter
ultimately brought me back to the topic of the note I made in the
last chapter, where humanity always ends in one fashion and flourishing
is subjective and meaningless, whereas Christ has both saved us from
death and also tells of how we shouldn't depend solely on vain things,
and that we should rather solely depend on God, and all things will be
added unto us. Ultimately who cares how good I can optimize
selling my house or choosing decisions that will minimize worldly
regret in my life if I end up losing my soul?
