  + /What did you do?/ 

    Did some light things to wake up my body.
    note: going to take my kettlebell to college to do
    morning/evening mobility/strength/isometrics, also
    can take it outside to the soccer field to toss around,
    for a good time with ankle mobility.
    Also on that note, I want to improve ankle mobility along
    with other mobilities, so I'm going to start doing light
    plyometrics now, not even for track just for longevity.
    So, along with doing some strength and stuff with the kettlebell,
    I will remember to hop around like a bunny still, to keep my joints
    nice and healthy.

- [X] *Morning reflection*
  + /What are your thoughts?/

    I'm in bliss knowing that through my sorrows and downfalls, I can still go
    to Church and grow in God. Yes, Ava and I probably won't work out, but that
    doesn't mean I can't continue with her a little longer and show her love.
    I need to fix this, not show her my fallible love that is run off of modernity,
    but show her the never-ending love that God has shown the Church. Sacrifical Love.
    Love that will go to unending lengths to care for that person and to show that person
    that they're valuable in this world. The person loving them shows them that they're
    made in God's image and are valued as such. This shouldn't be a source of pride for
    someone, because once you realize and understand what God's image truly is, you realize
    it is Christ Himself. Who would stoop down to wash the feet of those made in His image.
    It's not a careless or reckless love, it's an infinite love that we people can't succeed
    at perfectly but even just a tid bit of it can change the world. Glory be to God, I dedicate
    my life to Him now and forever, and to ages of ages. Amen.

- [X] *Morning intention*
  + /Overall focus of today?/

    - Go to Church, have lunch and class at Church, then go back to college.
    - I might go to security
      to ask for a lost and found, just to get it out
      of the way.
    - See if I can get some assignments done
      + pygame midterm

      + foundations paper

      + foundations slideshow

      + all other projects/assignments

- [X] *Morning creativity*
  + /Feeling creative or smart?/

    I'm feeling creative by inserting an image like I did below.

    Important key macros to do so are C-u C-c C-l to insert and image file
    (C-u C-c C-l) [[file:~/Pictures/Screenshots/pic.png]] which could just be done by typing it out like shown (file:~/etc/etc/)

    then (C-c C-x C-v) to show the image

- [X] Mobility/Isometrics
  + /What did you do?/
    just some mobility with kettlebell, watched a youtube video for it.
- [X] *Evening reflection*

    It's going good, I feel like I will get a hang of my schedule and that
    org mode will be of great use to me in that endeavor.
- [X] *Evening thanks*
  + /How've you been blessed today?/
    With Church, I'm blessed to see Fr. Michael and all of the Church congregation, this is where I want my life, heaven on earth.
    With family, Laura getting me things I need so that I succeed, forever thankful to those who provide for me.
    With friends, Lathon is always a blast to talk to and be a friend of. I want our relationship to mature into a godly one, such
    that we leave childishness behind.
    With all of God's blessings, those that I notice and those I don't notice. He gives me the breath of life, glory to Him. 
- [X] *Evening creativity*
  + /What do you want to express?/
    I'm not sure if studying in that one room is a good idea but it's nice to hide away in that sense. It should be rare when I do
    go there because I can't rid of community and other things especially with CS when either I get help or helping others benefits me as well.
