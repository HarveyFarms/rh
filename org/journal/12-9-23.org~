** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I'm thankful for this day. During prayer I realized that God allowed me to
wake up and gave me a chance to pray to Him. Then, having accepted this chance,
He further allowed me to acknowledge Him.

Also, last night and this morning I've been tempted to sin, but haven't, just
because I was too tired. If only this would happen everytime! But it helped me
realize that I shouldn't follow my own will, ultimately.

** DONE Morning intention

To have a productive day using pomodoro.

I'm fasting breakfast so that I can eat normally for lunch, and
we'll see for dinner.
