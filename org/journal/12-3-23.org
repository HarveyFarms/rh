** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I felt sick in the bathroom, so I decided not to go to Church. It was just a temporary sickness.
Forgive me, Lord.

Then I tripped up in my evil and sinful passions. Forgive me, Lord.

I feel miserable, but I have a sliver of hope and faith. And an atomic size of love for others and for God.

May I grow these Lord, only through You. With Your help and guidance. With me calling upon your Name for all good things.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Maybe get a haircut, maybe get gas on the way there.

Fast, but eat regularly. This is my plan for the next two weeks.

But today, I will get some work done.
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried by day in the night before You.
Let my prayer come before You, incline Your ear to my supplication, O Lord.

If I let the passions override me, I will not only hurt myself, I will injure
others in their spiritual path, because of my influence and connection to them.

I will also make those in Heaven cry over me, the sheep who is lost and cannot be found.

I have to pray continually to the Almighty True God. 

"Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers _for all believers everywhere_" Ephesians 6:18
