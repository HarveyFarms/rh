*** /What did you do? 
Mix of kettlebell mobility and bodyweight mobility.
** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I felt sick in the bathroom, so I decided not to go to Church. It was just a temporary sickness.
Forgive me, Lord.

Then I tripped up in my evil and sinful passions. Forgive me, Lord.

I feel miserable, but I have a sliver of hope and faith. And an atomic size of love for others and for God.

May I grow these Lord, only through You. With Your help and guidance. With me calling upon your Name for all good things.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Maybe get a haircut, maybe get gas on the way there.

Fast, but eat regularly. This is my plan for the next two weeks.

But today, I will get some work done.
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
O Lord God of my salvation, I have cried by day in the night before You.
Let my prayer come before You, incline Your ear to my supplication, O Lord.

If I let the passions override me, I will not only hurt myself, I will injure
others in their spiritual path, because of my influence and connection to them.

I will also make those in Heaven cry over me, the sheep who is lost and cannot be found.

I have to pray continually to the Almighty True God. 

"Pray in the Spirit at all times and on every occasion. Stay alert and be persistent in your prayers _for all believers everywhere_" Ephesians 6:18

** DONE Make sure all daily goals are met 
** DONE Mobility/Isometrics ideas: [[~/kettlebell.org][w/kettlebell]] [[mobility.org][w/o kettlebell]]
*** /What did you do?/
just some easy kettlebell mobility
** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
I have the urge to say "it's going alright" or "well" or whatever.
But I sin constantly and my relationships around me are getting shattered.
I know to trust in the Lord, but I don't even know if I can trust in myself to do that.

Baptism is a need, and living by Christ's commandments is also a need. Theosis is something
I want to strive for and I feel I need to strive for to achieve salvation and eternal love
with the Creator of all, our Creator.
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
I've been blessed by solitude, but at the same time I used this solitude to do horrible things.
Solitude benefitted me greatly, until I used it for vain pleasure.

I want to rid of my phone and unworthy distractions (that my phone is amazing at doing)

I will see about how I go about this.
** DONE Evening creativity
*** /What do you want to express?/                        
here are all of the discrete math symbols I learned today:
[[~/Pictures/Screenshots/ez.png]]
along with others such as conditional statements (p -> q) p therefore q, or q is the necessary precondition for p
and biconditional statements (p <-> q) p if and only if q, if p then q, and vice versa.

conditional statements can be arranged in inverse, contrapositive and converse notation. Only contrapositive always
retains truth value with the original (p -> q) conditional statement (they're equivalent). And inverse and converse
are also equivalent.
