*** /What are your thoughts?/
I totally just went off schedule this morning, and I have a deep urge to
just watch and watch youtube forever and ever. I should stop this ...

The devil is trying to drag me down to a state of sloth but I won't allow it ...

I thank God for the very breath that I breathe. I thank God for the universe He created,
that has its laws such that we are able to live and experience Him and His world unchanging.

I thank God for me waking up today. Let me put it to good use.

***** summarization:
This chapter went over the narrator's life in prison, but
from a different point of view. After the last chapter,
the focus of this chapter was now more on convicts
companionship and how that effected his stay. He
mentioned more characters, some of which are unimportant,
but some of which he grew fond of. One way this chapter
focused more on an individuals view of belonging was
how the prison accomodated more towards noblemen than
the lower-class. This was evident in that the noblemen
wouldn't be tortured just for the sake of being tortured,
since there was a movement in the past couple decades that
would shame a general if he did so. Noblemen would usually
have the same work as the lower-class, unless they were
secretly used for their knowledgeable skills.

The chapter also talked of the major and other generals
that would work in certain departments of the prison.
This chapter ended on the Major having to resign because
of all of the sins he had committed and the mistreatment
he gave to the prison and its population. Dostoyevsky went
on to say that after he resigned it was seen how low a man
can seem in normal clothes after having prided himself in
honors all of his authoritative life.
