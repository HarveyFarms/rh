*** done evening reflection
Today had wild highs and lows, from sinning horribly in the morning to praying with some fervor that I hadn't done in a while. Practice for track was hard as well. Crazy day, I just hope I can continue my prayer and spiritual life and GO TO CHURCH SUNDAY!! also to get some work done. Have mercy, Lord.
