** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I've broken up with Ava.

Today is the start of a new life, where I now know not to go for looks solely.

I shall search for Truth in my life.

** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To study some math and ciss240.

I will probably leave all of python for after tuesday's finals, just
because I imagine the final will be easy and I only need a little
refresher on types of lists/arrays in python I believe, and extracting
things from files/websites, etc ...
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
Proving all of the differentiation formulas was fun.

It's just a matter of knowing what direction you're going, and making reasonable
algebra moves to get there. Solving the Quotient Rule is my favorite.
