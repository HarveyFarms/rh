** daily
*** done [[https://goarch.org][morning prayer/Lives of the Saints/Lectionary]]
*** done duolingo
*** done morning reflection
woke up late again, really wondering whether I should do my daily readings or not. Most of all, I should be constantly against the passions, which I fail at. I need to not look at social media, maybe swap out long hot showers in the evening to a short hot shower and then a cold shower in the morning. And going to sleep at a good time and waking up appropriately will help as well.
