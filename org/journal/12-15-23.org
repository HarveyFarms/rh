"I lay down and slept, I awoke, for the Lord will help me"

I'm extremely grateful for God, especially after yesterday when
my eyes were open to His almighty saving grace, in which His name
has power over the devil when trying to tempt me. I may have known
this fact before, but it was a fact in my life that faded away
because its foundation kept flying away.

As Fr. Michael said, we tend to make problems harder than they really are.
And maybe these problems are hard, for just us to solve them, but with God
as our helper, they shall be nothing to Him.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
Get some things done this morning to start my day off right,
then go down and see how my family is doing after I pack up
and leave. I'm not sure what I'll do for lunch but I want
to get back on the fast, so I may go to a grocery store to
pick up some tuna, hummus, things like this and remember to take
my iodized salt with me since I'll be eating extra soy during the
fast.

***** summarization:
Dostoyevksy ends off the book with talking of how two convicts escaped
and how that effected the convicts in the prison. First they overjoyed
and praised the convicts, until the convicts were caught, then they reviled
and despised them.

Then in the last chapter, Dostoyevsky tells of his last days in prison. He
tells of how he bid farewell to his companions and how most of them ended
in a tender fashion. He ends off the book with describing his leave of prison
as a resurrection.
