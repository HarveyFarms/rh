** DONE Morning thanksgiving & reflection 
I thank God for not destroying me while I'm still an unrepentant sinner,
He is the true, merciful God.

I thank the Holy Trinity for having brought to me the true faith, of which
I can grow stronger and not fall away in lack of faiths in other beliefs.

I walked the dogs, and will be with them for the next couple days because
everyone else left for Texas. I plan to get work done, eat healthy and
take care of the dogs.

** DONE Plan
To see how this day goes so I can gauge my other days.
I want to take the dogs out multiple times a day, and
not have them in their crates for long periods of time.

I also want to get all of my daily things done for the day
so I have time for coding, math, and other things I want
to do over the break

I'm still not sure about working out, I wouldn't mind going
to the warehouse but do I really want to? No, not really.
It sucks that I have this mindset, and we'll see I may force myself to go.
** DONE Bible
*** Old Testament
Jacob comes to see his son Joseph in Egypt. The famine continues and people
have to sell their land and eventually their freedom to Joseph so that they can eat.

It gives a genealogy of Joseph and his brothers, of which some names are recognizable.

Then, it tells of how Jacob is nearing his earthly life, so he gets Joseph to promise that
he will bury him in the land of Canaan, the land of his people.

Then, Jacob blesses Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, that they will continue in the faith
of Abraham and follow the God that was revealed to them. Joseph tries to make this blessing only
for Manasseh, the first-born, but Jacob insists that they both be blessed, so that their seed
will prevail and eventually bear the Messiah himself.
*** Psalms
Psalm 19 is about rejoicing and exalting the Lord God and His salvation for His people.
*** Proverbs
These proverbs tell me to not fear my enemies when I'm intimidated by them, rather fear the Lord.
Because going against Him is wicked, but going against wickedness He will uphold me.

It talks of practical wisdom and guidance:
1. Give to the poor, and don't delay such a thing.
2. Don't harm a friend, for they trust in you.
*** New Testament
The Pharisees saw Jesus' disciples eating some grain from
grainfields on the Sabbath, and rebuked Him. He responded
using the OT, saying that Daniel and his followers ate of
the priestly bread in the temple, because the Law is not
made for man, but man for the Law. Human needs aren't
overlooked, and they are of higher priority than the Law.

Then Jesus went and healed people, and told them not to tell,
so that it may be fulfilled in Isaiah 42:1-4, for three reasons:

1. the growing hostility of the Jewish leaders
2. the people's misunderstanding of the Messiah as an earthly, political leader
3. our Lord's desire to evoke genuine faith not based solely on marvelous signs.
