** DONE Morning thanksgiving & reflection 
I thank God for not destroying me while I'm still an unrepentant sinner,
He is the true, merciful God.

I thank the Holy Trinity for having brought to me the true faith, of which
I can grow stronger and not fall away in lack of faiths in other beliefs.

I walked the dogs, and will be with them for the next couple days because
everyone else left for Texas. I plan to get work done, eat healthy and
take care of the dogs.

** DONE Plan
To see how this day goes so I can gauge my other days.
I want to take the dogs out multiple times a day, and
not have them in their crates for long periods of time.

I also want to get all of my daily things done for the day
so I have time for coding, math, and other things I want
to do over the break

I'm still not sure about working out, I wouldn't mind going
to the warehouse but do I really want to? No, not really.
It sucks that I have this mindset, and we'll see I may force myself to go.
** DONE Bible
*** Old Testament
Jacob comes to see his son Joseph in Egypt. The famine continues and people
have to sell their land and eventually their freedom to Joseph so that they can eat.

It gives a genealogy of Joseph and his brothers, of which some names are recognizable.

Then, it tells of how Jacob is nearing his earthly life, so he gets Joseph to promise that
he will bury him in the land of Canaan, the land of his people.

Then, Jacob blesses Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, that they will continue in the faith
of Abraham and follow the God that was revealed to them. Joseph tries to make this blessing only
for Manasseh, the first-born, but Jacob insists that they both be blessed, so that their seed
will prevail and eventually bear the Messiah himself.
*** Psalms
Psalm 19 is about rejoicing and exalting the Lord God and His salvation for His people.
*** Proverbs
These proverbs tell me to not fear my enemies when I'm intimidated by them, rather fear the Lord.
Because going against Him is wicked, but going against wickedness He will uphold me.

It talks of practical wisdom and guidance:
1. Give to the poor, and don't delay such a thing.
2. Don't harm a friend, for they trust in you.
*** New Testament
The Pharisees saw Jesus' disciples eating some grain from
grainfields on the Sabbath, and rebuked Him. He responded
using the OT, saying that Daniel and his followers ate of
the priestly bread in the temple, because the Law is not
made for man, but man for the Law. Human needs aren't
overlooked, and they are of higher priority than the Law.

Then Jesus went and healed people, and told them not to tell,
so that it may be fulfilled in Isaiah 42:1-4, for three reasons:

1. the growing hostility of the Jewish leaders
2. the people's misunderstanding of the Messiah as an earthly, political leader
3. our Lord's desire to evoke genuine faith not based solely on marvelous signs.

***** summarization:
"The Incomprehensible Character of Self-reproach"
The words "Keep thy mind in hell and despair not" may perplex people, but
the deep meaning and practicality of these words describes the ethos of the
Orthodox Christian. Keeping ones mind in hell is acknowledging the worldly
and spiritual powers that are against Him and the One whose image is bestowed
on him. To know this state and to repent for partaking in this devilish plot
against Him is keeping ones mind in hell, and forsaking not is when the Christian
has faith, hopes, and loves his God who will deliver him and all through Him who
died for our sins.
The chapter continues talking of demonology, and how our turning from God is different,
in that their rebellion is eternal, whereas ours is temporal and we can fix it through and
in Christ.
It talks of how God allows temptations to arise in us, so that we may overcome them and
show our love for God. So that we are strengthened and truly live a rational life which
God hath provided. Though, we aren't perfect, so when our created will has suffered greatly,
and we fall into despair, we shouldn't stay there long, and return to God who will extend
His almighty hand to His faithful. God is always there, whether we need Him or not, but we
always need Him, so that we are strengthened and become deified after being worthy and taking
His most pure Body and Blood in the mysteries of His Church.
On the words that Saint Silouan received, he said, "Since then I have stayed my mind in hell
and I burn in the sombre fire, yearning after the Lord and seeking Him in tears."

This chapter kept clarifying what the individual words mean, so that interpretation doesn't fall
outside of Christ's Church and its teachings.

The next chapter "Thanksgiving" shows an inverse to the words that St. Silouan received, where first
the faithful one thanks God for all that one can list, and in doing this they are ever reminded of
how they themselves corrupt the good things that Christ has given them.

Finished this book, it was a great book to show and explain Christ's way of life, which included praying
and suffering, and how these two are the biggest parts of a Christian life, to call upon the Lord our God
and to go throughout this harsh world living in His commandments which brings His creation to how it should
be, good, when He created it. The Christian life, as shown in this book, is one of dying daily to the ways
of the world, and to live in Christ, who has destroyed death by death.
**** Algorithms to Live By
***** starting page: 59
***** ending page  : 84
***** summarization:
The _sorting_ algorithm:

two main ways it is used:

1. a systemic way to sort ordinally n amount of things
   You have to compare these, meaning you have to atleast see everything once,
   but then have to see comparatively which ones are "higher/lower" than others.
   
2. an organic way to sort cardinally any new amount of things
   things aren't necessarily "sorted" like how a list or array of numbers would be,
   it is organic, like little fish not bumping into sharks in the see or little monkeys
   not fighting the biggest monkey in the kingdom, these things happen naturally because
   there's a measure or cardinal number that is a guiding factor in these processes.

** DONE Reflection
Today went amazing, I finished _Hypostatic Prayer_, and I thought
that I would go straight on to read the Divine Liturgy book but I
think I will wait on that so that I'm only reading one book right
now because I do want to prepare for next semester at least a little
bit where right now it seems I'm reading more than what seems good for
me, since I'm trying to finish two books quickly by reading 30+ pages
of both, which right now I want to do to get some books finished, but I
shouldn't do that of two books if I want to get some computer/other work
done as well. I could manage it, only if I fixed my sleep schedule and
pomodoro'd and efficiently maxed my day out but this is also a break,
so I don't want to go into next semester like these semesters were merged
together ( which is what it would seem like if I tried to read two books
in huge chunks while noting them alongside the Bible which I've started
noting to recap what I've read better alongside the computer/math work
I want to get done to be better prepared for next semester. )
** DONE Thanks
I thank God for this day, as usual on a day that goes amazing in the morning, I'm disobedient
to God and I sin gravely, such a grave sin where a man was killed because he wasted his seed
as I do as well, and this all starts with pride which then leads to lust and so on...
** DONE Remembrance 
I've sinned in pride, which led to these sins, in order:
I've sinned in gluttony, by eating abundantly and not having prudence to go shopping
for longer lasting, more fulfilling meals that I wouldn't have the trouble of understanding
measurements (if i were more prudent), God help me to understand myself, my appetite and the
cause of all sin, pride.
After this, I was despondent, on my phone, the laziest, most sloth filled hobby that I could ever do,
yet I feed it everyday, have mercy on me.
Then, finally, while all of these sins piled on me, I couldn't discern what God wanted me to do, and I
sinned in lust, have mercy on me. I shall call upon Your name everyday Lord, when the demons try to tear
me away from You.
