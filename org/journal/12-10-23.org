*** /What did you do?/ 
Some good mobility with kettlebell and then some strength exercises added on.
** DONE Morning reflection
*** /What are your thoughts?/
I've broken up with Ava.

Today is the start of a new life, where I now know not to go for looks solely.

I shall search for Truth in my life.

** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
To study some math and ciss240.

I will probably leave all of python for after tuesday's finals, just
because I imagine the final will be easy and I only need a little
refresher on types of lists/arrays in python I believe, and extracting
things from files/websites, etc ...
** DONE Morning creativity
*** /Feeling creative or smart?/
Proving all of the differentiation formulas was fun.

It's just a matter of knowing what direction you're going, and making reasonable
algebra moves to get there. Solving the Quotient Rule is my favorite.

***** summarization:
Aleksandr Petrovich overhears a conversation at the hospital of two men.
One of the men is telling the story in a fervor, and it ends up being of
a woman whom he married. He described how this woman had been known to be
"loose" but at the same time honorable. The man talking, her husband, was
beyond cruel and beat her and eventually killed her because she confessed
her love for a man in her past that repented to her.

Grotesque images ...

Also, I need to mindfully summarize each page I read, and also to keep
summarizing in this way with org-mode. But if it's a book I care about
I may want to make an .org file about it to keep track of events and
have the story laid out very clearly so I don't lose track of anything.

Dostoyevsky was truly blessed with his work. I pray for his soul.

*** /How's it all going?/
It's going alright. I need to turn back to God and not return to my evil and sinful habits.

I need to continue praying for others, and for those that I've hurt.

I definitely feel more alone now but that's okay, because God will always be by my side ... ps 23
** DONE Evening thanks

Church today was absolutely amazing. I'm starting to branch out and talk
with other people than what I usually stick to, and I need to continue
doing that.
** DONE Evening creativity
*** /What do you want to express?/

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

He makes me lie down in green pastures, He
leads me beside the still waters.

He restores my soul, He leads me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for
You are with me, Your rod and Your staff,
They comfort me.

You prepare a table before me in the presence
of my enemies.

You anoint my head with oil, my cup runs over.

Surely Your goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.
