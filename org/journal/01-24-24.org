Good day tomorrow, an even better day today, God-willing. I want to grow in the fasts.

One thing I have to realize is that any sort of imaginings I have are impeding my progress. If I pray, I should have my prayer rope along with me, and if I'm not focus, I focus instead on the jesus prayer and then return where I left off.
