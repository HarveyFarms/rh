** DONE Morning reflection & thanksgiving
Thank You Lord, for giving me this day, wherefore I may offer You worthy repentance.

I have begun to not care about my journal, my daily .org file.
This has led to me not praying, not jotting my notes, and not
getting things done.

I have to realize that lust and falling in the sin of masturbation (purely pleasure-driven self-willed cuckery)
isn't the only sin. And that falling into other sins of despondency such as gluttony and sloth, I am not only
at an increased risk to sin even worse, but I'm at an increased risk to NOT pray and turn to God, offer up my
will to be transformed into His. This is the ultimate fault, because it is building my house on sand. When hard
times come, will I even think to turn to God in prayer? Or will I act foolishly, not keeping His words close to
my heart? This is crucial in my sojourn in this world. I have decided that this life is not owed to created,
vainful things, but it is owed to Christ. He will help me in my journey to better know Him and to establish a
mystical relationship with Him in which I am deified. This only comes through making my will conform to His, just
as His human will conformed and was in harmony with His divine will when He was incarnate in the flesh, so will I
conform my will to His divine will, the will of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.

This is a path that will endure hard times, and will struggle and suffer, but it is the only path to righteousness,
to becoming what God wanted of humans, to become one with Him in will, so that we may glorify Him through ourselves,
and we may be in eternal harmony and love with our Creator...
