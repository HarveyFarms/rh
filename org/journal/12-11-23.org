***** summarization:
This was the ending of commentary on the Lord's prayer.

It talked of temptations, and how theologically it is used for our good
and it doesn't come from God, but God allows it so that we might become
athletes for Him.

Also practically it talked of how man should avoid temptations, and even
the environment that entraps him. It talks of how Christ endured temptations,
and how He sets the best example where the Saints then showed a great example for
us to follow that we might become partakers of the divine grace as well.

It's exciting before finals, I don't know what to expect.

I might die of excitement.

*** /How've you been blessed today?/
Thank You Lord, for giving me parents that check up on me. May they be in Your blessed memory.

Thank You Lord, for giving me time to tend to my studies, instead of working like an honest man.

Thank You Lord, for not putting me away from Your sight, because of my unworthiness and slothfulness.
** DONE Remembrance 
*** /Enter any sins you have committed today./
Slothfulness, not focusing on my studies and sitting and eating watching youtube forever and ever.
Lord Jesus Christ, Son and Word of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

Lord Jesus Christ, Son and Word of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.
