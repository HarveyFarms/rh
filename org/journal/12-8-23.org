want to come back into His arms.

***** summarization:
This was the third chapter of the Hospital section.
It started off talking about executioners and their
psychology and practice on the convicts.

Then it shifted more toward hospital life, where it
mentioned mentally ill convicts who would show up in
the hospital.

Finally, it ended with general life in the hospital.
It was described that though the hospital isn't the best,
it's one of the places where Alexander can rest.
