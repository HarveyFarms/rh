**** Hypostatic Prayer
***** starting page: 117
***** ending page  : 139
***** study/read   : study
***** summarization:
The first chapter, types and definitions of hypostatic prayer, led the
other chapters in that it described certain types and examples the fa-
ithful can look up to in order to do hypostatic prayer correctly. One
major takeaway is Christ's prayer in Gethsemane, in which He was swea-
ting blood after praying for the whole world, both for those in the p-
ast, present and future. This prayer is intense because it strikes the
essence of mankind, that we need God because we have fallen, we conti-
nue to fall and we will fall in the future. It's a sad reality but Ch-
rist saves us from this reality. He destroyed death by death. Glory be
to Him.

** DONE Make sure all daily goals are met 
** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
It's going alright, I don't even know if these are of use to be mandatory, without them, I wouldn't
let out thoughts that I decide I want to write about, it's a good way to open up and express my
thoughts, so I'll keep it for now.
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
God blessed me with life, waking up early and getting after work.

Most of the day, I was hard-working, but then in the evening I broke the fast when
I agreed for my dad to get me a King Burrito, so I let that little fall in my fast
dictate the rest of my night, which turned out to be a little slothful and indulgent.

Lord, have mercy.
** DONE Remembrance 
*** /Enter any sins you have committed today./
Gluttony, sloth.
