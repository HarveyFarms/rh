*** /What are your thoughts?/
This morning has been going very well, reading Scripture and my book in the morning
is an amazing idea and I might even go to bed earlier and wake up early so I can
get all of my reading done for the day. I should finish my dostoyevsky book before
Friday and during Christmas break I can finish my Hypostatic Prayer book aswell.

I thank God for the peace He gives me, the constant remembrance of wrongs that
helps me draw closer to Him that contrast with His godly and ever-so perfect
example, that is possible for us through Him.

May Glory and dominion be with Him always now and forever, and to ages of ages. Amen.
** DONE Morning intention
*** /Overall focus of today?/
I have a python exam, so this may be the last day I use python (unless in the future I
want to crank out a quick program or I end up using it for another class or my main
language--but that will be in some time ...). After the exam I plan to head straight to
the gym, to do some olympic weightlifing and some mobility/accessories. It won't be
heavily structured it will just be a fun day mostly.

***** summarization:
****** first read (288-302)
This chapter was all about animals in prison. It talked of how the convicts acted toward the animals
and what some convicts would do to the animals after the animal "disappears." This chapter led me
to believe that the narrator has more humanity in him than the other convicts do but also that the
convicts do have humanity left and sometimes it is shown through animals.
****** second read (302-321)
This chapter was about a complaint that the commoners made, but the complaint wasn't the main theme
of the chapter, rather it was about how the majority of the prison population of commoners didn't
see the noblemen or any outside foreigner to be "like them," such that even during the complaint
to the Major about the prison food, the commoners took it to the narrator when he tried to join
in the effort. This seemed the case because he had his own food, but so was there other commoners
or non-foreigners that were also apart of the complaint effort. This had a great impact on the
narrator, to such an extent that he ended up asking one of his commoner acquaintances (that was
at the very least polite to him) why it was so. This ended in the narrator getting his answer,
that his people are seperate from the majority or the main group of people.

Gluttony and breaking the fast yet again ...

Lust and masturbation ..
It raised the question to me,

"Who even are you, Ryan? Deep down, are you a follower of Christ or a
follower of the world? Do you trust Christ? Or would you rather indulge
in vain, temporal pleasures? Are you really apart of Christ's flock, or
is it just a fad?"
