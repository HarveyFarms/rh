***** summarization:
Dostoyevsky started this chapter after the last horrific chapter's ending
with a story on vagrants, or those who are able to leave prison. He expounds
that this is the desire of convicts in the spring, as the season aligns with
such thoughts. He then goes on to talk about work in the spring, and how he
worked brick-moving and how that made him physically stronger.

The chapter ended with a rumor that a general would be coming to the prison.
This excited the convicts, and they devised how they would tell the general,
who was doing inspection, all of the complaints they had of Major.

This ended up not happening, and the coming of the general was one of awe,
and stiffness.

** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
It's going well ... slow. 

A life without delusions is a life of patience and trust in God.

I haven't lived this life in a while, and I haven't lived a true life
in a while as well. Let me return back to a true life, O God.
** DONE Evening thanks

Through tests, God has blessed me with a clear head and knowledge where I needed it.

Through taking these tests, I got to be with some of my great friends, who should
continue being my friends forevermore.

** DONE Remembrance 
*** /Enter any sins you have committed today./
I have been filled with pride. Instead of taking today's accomplishments with

no good reason, other than me choosing to be unworthy in the sight of God.
