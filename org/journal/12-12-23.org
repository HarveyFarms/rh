Today is finals. Not the end of the world, but may God be with me

hymn Him to the ages. Amen.

We will do this after our finals
*** Thoughts
I plan to continue this on my Supernote but I have the
pdf there if it's ever needed and the days are counted
above.

I want to take notes on these individual sections, but
I plan instead to just read the Bible as is and under-
line/note in the Bible as needed, and if I have any
quick thoughts I can put them here in the org-file
just so I can articulate what I just read.
*** Reflection
Glory to You, our God, Glory to You.

The creation account, the beginning of Psalms and Proverbs
and also the beginning of the Gospel according to Matthew.

The extra pages that expounded on doctrine were helpful, and
I should read these as they come along in my plan. Because
alongside reading the creation account, I also learned more of
the Trinity in the Old Testament, Ancestral Sin, and Creation
in general that expounds upon how Orthodox believers should
go about reading the Old Testament compared to how "science"
tries to persuade men other ways. The main message of the last
point was that men should ultimately know God created all things,
and that creation or the world isn't inherently bad. I think this
covers a good portion theologically. 

** DONE Read/Note 10 pages or Read 20 pages of book

***** summarization:
Dostoyevsky started this chapter after the last horrific chapter's ending
with a story on vagrants, or those who are able to leave prison. He expounds
that this is the desire of convicts in the spring, as the season aligns with
such thoughts. He then goes on to talk about work in the spring, and how he
worked brick-moving and how that made him physically stronger.

The chapter ended with a rumor that a general would be coming to the prison.
This excited the convicts, and they devised how they would tell the general,
who was doing inspection, all of the complaints they had of Major.

This ended up not happening, and the coming of the general was one of awe,
and stiffness.

*** /What did you do?/
mobility with kettlebell 
** DONE Evening reflection
*** /How's it all going?/
It's going well ... slow. 

A life without delusions is a life of patience and trust in God.

I haven't lived this life in a while, and I haven't lived a true life
in a while as well. Let me return back to a true life, O God.
** DONE Evening thanks
*** /How've you been blessed today?/
Through tests, God has blessed me with a clear head and knowledge where I needed it.

Through taking these tests, I got to be with some of my great friends, who should
continue being my friends forevermore.

** DONE Remembrance 
*** /Enter any sins you have committed today./
I have been filled with pride. Instead of taking today's accomplishments with
humility, I immediately started boasting and broke the fast the entire day for
no good reason, other than me choosing to be unworthy in the sight of God.
